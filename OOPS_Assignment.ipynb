        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "   - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a coding approach that structures programs using objects, which bundle data (attributes) and actions (methods) together. It helps organize complex code by modeling real-world entities. OOP is built around four main principles: encapsulation (hiding internal details), inheritance (reusing code by creating child classes from parent classes), polymorphism (using a unified interface for different types), and abstraction (showing only essential features). By using classes as blueprints for creating objects, OOP promotes code reuse, scalability, and easier maintenance.\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "   - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have. A class acts like a template: it outlines how an object should behave and what information it should store. When you create an object (called an instance), it follows the structure defined by its class. Classes help organize code, promote reusability, and make programs easier to manage. In languages like Python, Java, and C++, classes are fundamental building blocks.\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "   - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is a specific instance of a class, containing real values instead of just a blueprint. Objects combine data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into a single unit, allowing programmers to model real-world things more naturally. Each object can have unique values for its attributes but share the structure and behavior defined by the class it’s created from. Objects interact with one another by calling methods and sharing information. They help break complex programs into smaller, manageable pieces. Examples include a Car object with properties like color and speed, and methods like drive or stop.\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "   - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), abstraction and encapsulation are different but related concepts. Abstraction focuses on hiding complex details and showing only the essential features of an object, making interactions simpler. It helps users work with higher-level ideas without worrying about the inner workings. Encapsulation, on the other hand, is about bundling data and methods together inside a class and restricting access to some parts of an object to protect the data. It enforces boundaries and maintains control over how data is modified. Together, they improve code clarity, security, and maintainability.\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "   - Dunder methods in Python are special methods that have double underscores (__) before and after their names, like __init__, __str__, and __add__. \"Dunder\" stands for \"double underscore.\" These methods let you define how objects of your class should behave with built-in functions and operators. For example, __init__ initializes a new object, __str__ defines what gets printed when you use print(), and __add__ allows custom behavior for the + operator. Dunder methods make classes more powerful and Pythonic, enabling cleaner and more intuitive code.\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "   - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), inheritance is a feature that allows a new class (called a child or subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from an existing class (called a parent or superclass). This promotes code reuse, avoids duplication, and makes programs easier to maintain. The child class can also add new features or override existing ones to specialize or change behavior. For example, a Vehicle class can have common traits, and Car and Bike classes can inherit from it while adding their own specific features. Inheritance supports a natural and logical hierarchy in code design.\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "   - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), polymorphism means \"many forms.\" It allows objects of different classes to be treated through a common interface, even if they behave differently. With polymorphism, you can call the same method name on different objects, and each will respond in its own way based on its class. This makes programs more flexible and easier to extend. For example, a Bird and an Airplane class might both have a fly() method, but each one implements it differently. Polymorphism is often achieved through method overriding and interfaces in languages like Python, Java, and C++.\n",
        "8.  How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "   - In Python, encapsulation is achieved by controlling access to a class’s data and methods. You use access modifiers: variables or methods starting with a single underscore (_) are treated as \"protected\" (intended for internal use), and double underscores (__) make them \"private\" (harder to access directly from outside the class). Encapsulation helps protect an object's internal state and provides controlled ways (like getter and setter methods) to interact with the data. This ensures better data security, organization, and maintenance in programs.\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "   - A constructor in Python is a special method used to initialize the state of an object when it is created. It is defined using the __init__ method within a class. The constructor is automatically called when an instance (object) of the class is created, and it allows for the assignment of initial values to object attributes. Constructors can also accept parameters, which enable customization of the object's initial state. While the __init__ method does not return a value (it returns None by default), it is crucial for setting up an object’s properties and ensuring it’s ready for use.\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "   - In Python, class and static methods are special types of methods defined within a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Class Method**: Defined using classmethod, it takes `cls` as the first parameter, representing the class itself. It can modify class-level attributes and is called on the class rather than an instance. It is useful for factory methods or altering class-level data.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Static Method**: Defined with staticmethod, it does not take `self` or `cls` as a parameter. It behaves like a regular function but belongs to the class. Static methods are used for utility functions that don’t need to access or modify class or instance data.\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "   - Method overloading in Python refers to the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. Unlike languages like Java, Python does not support traditional method overloading directly. However, it can achieve similar behavior using default arguments or variable-length argument lists (`*args`, `**kwargs`). When a method is called, Python selects the appropriate version based on the number and type of arguments passed. You can also manually handle different parameter combinations within a single method using conditional logic. This allows flexibility, but Python doesn’t inherently differentiate methods solely by their signature.\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "   - Method overriding in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows the subclass to modify or extend the behavior of the inherited method to suit its needs. The method in the subclass must have the same name, signature, and parameters as the one in the superclass. Overriding is essential for achieving polymorphism, where the subclass version of the method is called instead of the superclass version, even when using a reference of the superclass type. This enables dynamic method resolution at runtime based on the actual object type.\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "   - In Python, the property decorator is used to define methods that act like attributes. It allows you to define getter, setter, and deleter methods for an attribute, enabling controlled access to the attribute’s value. Using property, a method can be accessed like an attribute, while still allowing custom logic for getting the value. The property_name .setter decorator is used to define a setter method, allowing modification of the attribute, while property_name .deleter` can define behavior for deleting the attribute. This provides a clean way to manage attributes with additional functionality without directly exposing the method calls.\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "   - Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is important because it allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass. This enables a single interface to interact with different types of objects, improving code flexibility and reusability. Polymorphism supports method overriding, where subclasses can provide their own implementation of a method, allowing for dynamic behavior based on the object's actual type. This reduces code duplication, enhances maintainability, and promotes scalability by allowing new classes to be added without altering existing code. It fosters cleaner, more modular design in OOP systems.\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "   - An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is meant to be subclassed. It defines a blueprint for other classes, containing abstract methods that must be implemented by any subclass. Abstract methods are declared using the `@abstractmethod` decorator from the `abc` module. Abstract classes can also include concrete methods with default behavior. They provide a way to enforce a common interface and structure across multiple subclasses, ensuring that derived classes implement essential functionality. Abstract classes promote code consistency and help define a clear object-oriented design.\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "   - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers several advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Modularity**: Code is organized into objects and classes, promoting modularity and easier maintenance.\n",
        "2. **Reusability**: Classes can be reused across different programs, reducing code duplication.\n",
        "3. **Encapsulation**: Data and methods are bundled together within objects, protecting the internal state and exposing only necessary functionality.\n",
        "4. **Inheritance**: Allows new classes to inherit attributes and behaviors from existing ones, enhancing code reuse.\n",
        "5. **Polymorphism**: Enables objects of different types to be treated uniformly, improving flexibility and scalability.\n",
        "6. **Abstraction**: Hides complex details and exposes only essential features, simplifying interactions.\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "   - In Python, **class variables** are shared across all instances of a class. They are defined within the class but outside any methods, and their values are the same for every instance. Modifying a class variable affects all instances of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Instance variables**, on the other hand, are specific to each object (instance) created from the class. They are defined within methods, typically the constructor (`__init__`), and their values can differ from one instance to another. Changing an instance variable only affects that specific object, not others.\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "   - Multiple inheritance in Python occurs when a class inherits from more than one parent class. This allows a subclass to inherit attributes and methods from multiple superclasses, enabling the reuse of code from different sources. In Python, multiple inheritance is supported directly, unlike some other languages. However, it can introduce complexity, especially when multiple parent classes have methods with the same name. Python uses the **Method Resolution Order (MRO)** to determine the order in which methods are inherited from parent classes. While powerful, multiple inheritance should be used carefully to avoid ambiguity and maintain code clarity.\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        "    - In Python, `__str__` and `__repr__` are special methods used for representing an object as a string.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`__str__`**: Defines the string representation of an object for end-users. It is used by the `print()` function and `str()` to produce a readable, user-friendly string.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`__repr__`**: Defines the official string representation of an object, aimed at developers. It should ideally provide enough information to recreate the object using `eval()`. If `__str__` is not defined, `__repr__` is used as a fallback.\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "   - The `super()` function in Python is used to call methods from a superclass in a subclass. It allows for method overriding, enabling a subclass to extend or modify the behavior of inherited methods. Using `super()`, you can invoke the parent class's method without explicitly naming it, promoting code reusability and avoiding hard-coding the superclass name. This is especially useful in multiple inheritance scenarios, as `super()` respects the Method Resolution Order (MRO), ensuring that the correct method is called from the appropriate class. It helps keep code cleaner, maintainable, and less error-prone.\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "   - The `__del__` method in Python is a special method used for object destruction or cleanup when an object is about to be deleted. It is called when an object's reference count drops to zero, meaning there are no more references to the object. This method allows you to release external resources, such as closing files, network connections, or freeing memory. However, it’s important to note that relying on `__del__` for resource management can be risky, as Python's garbage collector may not guarantee when it will be called. For reliable resource cleanup, it’s better to use context managers with statement or explicit resource management methods.\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "   - In Python, staticmetho and classmethod are both used to define methods that are not bound to an instance of the class, but they differ in their behavior:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`@staticmethod`**: This decorator defines a method that doesn’t take `self` or `cls` as its first argument. It behaves like a regular function but belongs to the class. It cannot access or modify class or instance attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`@classmethod`**: This decorator defines a method that takes `cls` as its first argument, representing the class itself. It can modify class-level attributes or create instances of the class. It is typically used for factory methods or modifying class-level data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both provide alternative ways to interact with class behavior without using an instance.\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "   - In Python, polymorphism with inheritance allows objects of different subclasses to be treated as instances of a common superclass, enabling dynamic method behavior. When a method is overridden in a subclass, polymorphism ensures that the subclass's version of the method is called, even if the object is referenced by the superclass type. This is achieved through method overriding, where the subclass provides its own implementation of a method defined in the superclass. Polymorphism allows for flexible and reusable code, as the same method call can produce different results depending on the actual object type, enabling dynamic behavior at runtime.\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "   - Method chaining in Python OOP refers to the technique of calling multiple methods on the same object in a single statement. This is achieved by having methods return the object itself self, allowing for consecutive method calls. For example, obj.method1 .method2 .method3. Method chaining is commonly used to create more concise and readable code, especially when performing a sequence of operations on an object. It’s often used in scenarios like building fluent interfaces, where methods modify the object’s state or properties step by step, making the code more elegant and less repetitive.\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "   - The `__call__` method in Python allows an object to be called like a function. When an instance of a class has a `__call__` method, you can use parentheses `()` to invoke the object as if it were a function. This is useful for creating callable objects, enabling a class to have flexible behavior. The `__call__` method can accept arguments, making it behave like a regular function. It’s often used in scenarios where an object needs to represent a function or when you want to implement behavior similar to a function but with object-oriented features.\n"
